# SDG
This project employs a multivariate regression model in order to understand how impact of action towards climate change affects the SDG scores of European countries.

# Research Question
For this regression model, we observe the indicators monitored by the United Nations to achieve SDG 13 i.e. climate change. These variables include Greenhouse gas emissions, Carbon Dioxide emitted through imports and exports, utilization of renewable energy, the International Spillover Index and
historic trends in combating climate change. In calculating the SDG scores of countries, each Sustainable Goal is given equal weightage. As the European Nations have not achieved this goal and are still on track, the expected outcome of this paper would be that action towards SDG 13 contributes to a moderate part of the SDG Scores. The larger portion of the scores is expected to be attributed to the goals that have already been achieved or are close to being achieved, such as poverty, education and equality.

# Data and Methodology
This paper uses secondary data that has been gathered from the European Commission and the European Sustainable Development Report. Based on the availability of data, 35 European countries have been used for this study and all the data has been gathered from the year 2019.
